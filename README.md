A small app to encrypt or decrypt a piece of text with Caesar cipher. Currently works with a latin layout only.
An encryption if performed by rotation of the piece of char table (unicode) with a following symbol substitution, hence even spaces and punctuation marks are shifted. Non-latin symbol will be replaced with a zero element from a rotated table. ROT input field is the only mandatory field in the app. No bigger than 3-digit numbers are allowed to set a shift.
